## Introduction

This project is a Python-based maze generator and solver that uses recursive backtracking for both generating the maze and solving it. The program includes visualizations using a graphics library to animate the maze creation and solution process. 

The goal of this project is to explore fundamental algorithms for pathfinding and backtracking while providing an interactive visualization of the process.

## Features

- **Maze Generation**:
  - Creates a random maze using recursive backtracking.
  - Includes a configurable entrance and exit.

- **Maze Solving**:
  - Solves the maze using recursive backtracking.
  - Animates the solution path and backtracking process.

- **Visualization**:
  - Uses the `tkinter` library to display the maze generation and solving process step-by-step.

- **Testing**:
  - Includes unit tests for key components (`tests.py`).

## Requirements

- **Python**: Version 3.10 or higher
- **Dependencies**:
  - Tkinter

## Usage

### Run the Maze Program

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_folder>
   ```

2. Run the main program:
   ```bash
   ./main.sh
   ```

   Alternatively, you can directly run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python3 src/main.py
   ```

### Configure Maze Dimensions
The maze dimensions, cell size, and other parameters can be modified in `main.py`:

```python
maze = Maze(
    x1=0,
    y1=0,
    num_rows=10,  # Change the number of rows
    num_cols=10,  # Change the number of columns
    cell_size_x=20,
    cell_size_y=20,
    win=window,
    seed=42
)
```

---

## Testing

### Run Unit Tests

To run the tests, use the provided `tests.sh` script:
```bash
./tests.sh
```

Alternatively, execute the tests directly using Python:
```bash
python3 src/tests.py
```

### Add New Tests
To add your own tests, update the `tests.py` file located in the `src` directory.
